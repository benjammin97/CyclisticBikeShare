* Do members ride at different times/for different durations than casual riders?
* How long is the average bike ride?
#### Skills:
##### R
* Clean data by removing unnecessary columns and rows.
* Develop bar graphs and line graphs to generate valuable insights.
#### Outcomes:
Based on insights gained by data visualizations, several recommendations were made to increase rider membership based on the data, such as a weekend membership, a one hour membership, and a 3PM-6PM membership.  
#### Data Process Summary:
* Import libraries tidyverse, janitor, lubridate, and ggplot  
* Load the data using read.csv  
* Combine the data into a single dataframe using rbind  
* Remove empty rows and columns and eliminate invalid rows
